# u--1 experiment goals:

- zero loading time pre-cached html files
- well structured, no styling, minimum JS
- simple, navigable/searchable using browser UI
- attempt some difference in the UI

## 1 (sparklines)

[u--1.com](https://u--1.com)

- 250 svg price charts for the top coins, see every coin at a glance
- script.js fetches data from coingecko, compresses SVGs with SVGO, produces a single index.html file that's ~40kb brotli compressed
- script.js runs every 5 minutes in Cloudflare worker, index.html cached and served by Cloudflare
- u--1 is always available and loads instantly, short domain easy to type

Could run the script every 5 seconds to produce a live file, just need a coingecko api key. Would be intrigued to see what ~1000 charts would feel like also.
